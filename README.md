🩸 HematoVision — Blood Cell Classification using Transfer Learning
📌 Project Overview

HematoVision is an AI-powered web application that classifies microscopic blood cell images into different categories using deep learning and transfer learning.
The system helps medical professionals perform faster and more accurate blood cell analysis.

This project uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve classification accuracy while reducing training time.
